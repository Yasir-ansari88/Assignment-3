# Assignment-3
This repository contains two simple Python programs demonstrating basic concepts such as recursion and usage of the built-in `math` module.

Program 1: Factorial Calculation (`task-1.py`)

This program calculates the (factorial of a given number) using a **recursive function**.
* The user enters an integer.
* The program recursively multiplies numbers down to 1.
* The final factorial value is displayed.

Program 2: Mathematical Operations (`task-2.py`)

This program performs basic mathematical operations — square root, logarithm, and sine—on a user-provided number using Python’s `math` module.
* The user enters a number.
* The program calculates:
  * Square root
  * Natural logarithm
  * Sine value
* Results are displayed one by one.
